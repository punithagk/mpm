DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
The Presets module allows another module to define a set of presets for given functionality.  Often times
in order to get complex functionality to work, many modules are required to be downloaded and configured
correctly.  Presets helps by allowing a module to check and fix these settings so that end users
can get everything set up correctly.

INSTALLATION
---------------
* Upload the Presets directory to a modules directory on your server such as sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules.
* Enable the module via the admin > site building > modules
* Go to admin/presets to see if there are any presets available in your modules.

Please note that presets by itself does not provide any functionality.  You must install a module that
implements presets for any new functionality to occur.
